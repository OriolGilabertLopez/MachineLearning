# Welcome to my profile!

¡Hi, I'm Oriol Gilabert López!

I'm from Bacelona and I studied BSc in Applied Statistics. These studies have boosted my analytical skills and have provided me a strong mathematical background applied to data science. Moreover, they have given my a deep insight into statistical programming.

Currently, I'm developing programs/scripts on this field so I can apply all I have learned so far in  a work-place. I am confident that all the knowledge and experience acquired during the last years, along with my enthusiasm and hard work, will allow me to thrive in this fast-growing field. 


In the end, I'm new here and I would like to share with you my work as codes, notebook and handbooks about Machine Learning, statistical techniques and so on usign R, Pyhon or SQL. I will try to uplod new quality content weekly (if I can).

So.. ¡I hope you will enjoy it!
